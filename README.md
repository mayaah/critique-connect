# Critique Connect

### What and Why
Critique Connect is a website for writers to upload their works in progress (WIPs) and find beta readers to critique/review those works and a website for beta readers to look for WIPs they may be interested in reviewing. 

In the writing world, if you’re serious about publishing your work then you definitely need others to review/critique it before you send it to a literary agent. And these people cannot be your friends and family. So you find strangers on the Internet.

As a beta reader, your motivation for finding unpublished, not polished works to review and edit is 1) you might genuinely enjoy reading them 2) for monetary compensation or b/c you have a WIP that you want to exchange critiques for 3) critiquing other’s works makes you a stronger writer.

There are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1662819743977604/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook groups</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/50920-beta-reader-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodreads groups</a>, and <a href="https://absolutewrite.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?30-Beta-Readers-Mentors-and-Writing-Buddies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing forums</a> to find beta readers and works in progresses to beta read but no centralized place to view and find them and no uniform way to present this information. This is where CC has its value.
